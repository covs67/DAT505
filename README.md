Classical Audiovisual experience using three JS.

# How to run the project
This is just a traditional HTML/CSS/JS project.
To run the project you need to install web server on your PC.
You can also use any web servers out there like Apache, Nginx, or even simple development server will do the work.

For simplicity, I used Atom IDE with a package called Atom Live Server
To do this you need to do following steps.
 - Download and Install Atom
 - Install the Atom Live server package
 - Run the server and see the project work in real time


FOr apache or Nginx you just need to copy the project files into web root folder

Basically you can customize the following things with simple JS update
 - change background scenary

Actually this *can't* doesn't mean you really can't but means you need to do some extra works to do the following
 - Update material of cake model
